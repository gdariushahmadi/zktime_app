# API Compatibility Documentation

## ✅ API Format Verification

The ZKTeco Windows Application has been updated to be fully compatible with the required API format.

### API Endpoint
- **URL**: `https://panel.sdadparts.com/api/attendance/device-import`
- **Method**: POST
- **Content-Type**: `application/json`
- **Authentication**: Bearer Token

### Data Format Compliance

The application now sends data in the exact format required by the API:

```json
{
    "period": {
        "start_date": "2024-01-01",
        "end_date": "2024-01-31"
    },
    "attendance_records": [
        {
            "date": "2024-01-01",
            "id_number": "12345",
            "name": "John Doe",
            "times": ["08:00", "12:00", "13:00", "17:00"],
            "card": "0",
            "daily": {
                "date": "2024-01-01",
                "user_id": "12345",
                "attendance_details": [
                    {
                        "date": "2024-01-01",
                        "id_number": "12345",
                        "name": "John Doe",
                        "time": "08:00",
                        "status": "Check In",
                        "verification": "Fingerprint"
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### Key Features Implemented

✅ **Period Object**: Automatically calculates start and end dates from attendance data  
✅ **Attendance Records**: Groups attendance by date and user  
✅ **Times Array**: Chronologically sorted time entries for each user per day (H:i:s format)  
✅ **Daily Details**: Detailed attendance information when multiple entries exist  
✅ **Status Detection**: Automatically determines Check In/Check Out status  
✅ **Verification Method**: Defaults to "Fingerprint" for ZKTeco devices  
✅ **Card Field**: Set to "0" as per API specification  
✅ **User Name Extraction**: Properly extracts user names from device data  
✅ **Time Format Compliance**: Uses H:i:s format (08:00:00) as required by API  

### Data Processing Logic

1. **User Name Extraction**: Extracts user names from device user list using user_id lookup
2. **Grouping**: Attendance records are grouped by date and user ID
3. **Time Sorting**: All times for a user on a given day are sorted chronologically
4. **Time Formatting**: Times are formatted as H:i:s (e.g., "08:00:00") as required by API
5. **Status Assignment**: Alternating Check In/Check Out based on time sequence
6. **Daily Details**: Detailed records are included when multiple entries exist
7. **Period Calculation**: Start and end dates are calculated from actual data

### Authentication

The application uses the correct Bearer token format:
```
Authorization: Bearer 3|4GQYfJgpAhjlZfumsMMBrKvZyr68L9hVA3V9u5Fnd983ce66
```

### Error Handling

The application includes comprehensive error handling:
- Network connection errors
- Authentication failures
- Data validation errors
- Retry mechanism for transient failures

### Testing

Run the API format test to verify compatibility:
```bash
python3 test_api_format.py
```

This will:
- Verify the API endpoint configuration
- Test the data formatting logic
- Generate sample API requests
- Validate the output format

### Sample Output

The test script generates output like:
```
✅ API URL matches required endpoint
✅ API Format Test: PASSED
✅ Found 2 attendance records
✅ Record structure is correct
✅ Daily details included with 4 entries
✅ All tests passed! API format is correct.
```

### Integration Status

The Windows application is now fully compatible with the attendance dashboard API and will:

1. **Connect to ZKTeco devices** and retrieve attendance data
2. **Format the data** according to the API specification
3. **Send data to the server** using the correct endpoint and format
4. **Handle responses** and log success/failure status
5. **Retry on failures** with configurable retry attempts
6. **Log all activities** for monitoring and troubleshooting

The application is ready for production use with the attendance dashboard system.
